P.H. - "As a memer with specific taste, I'd like to customize the webpage's color theme."
COS:
- User has an options 'gear' icon in the top right with the text "options" next to it.
- After clicking the options icon, There will be a new menu appearing below it, with a clickable text box saying "Change Themes" at the top.  
Clicking the gear icon again closes this menu.
- Clicking on "Change Themes" opens up a new menu to the left of the "Change Themes" button.  

~Change themes is on the bottom, but I had to do that because I could only get the second dropdown menu to go down instead of to the left. Otherwise, I got everything else.

This will shows 4 clickable circles buttons.

~(I didn't write this, but I think the four buttons was a typo because it says "2 circles" later.)

Clicking the "Change Themes" button again or any other setting will close this 3rd menu.
-  The two circles are light grey(230,230,230), and black(20,20,20).
-  Clicking one of the circles will recolor the webpage text, borders, and windows [respectivley] with a new trifecta of colors based on the theme selected.
Text, Borders, and Windows respectivley:
-  White theme: 20x3, 173x3, 230x3
- Black Theme: 240x3 , 70x3, 12x3
- Settings windows close after Choice.

~I change the border color, but I don't really have borders ingrained into my page, so you can't tell.

Thankfully, I was actually able to fully complete all of the CoS this time :)
Sadly, I didn't really get to implement tests, but due to the merging (and the nature of my program mainly being static), I think my tests would end up being overwritten anyways.
The only real issue I had (not including the previous sprint) was getting the header to permenantly change the theme. Because of this, I added a theme option in the settings.
