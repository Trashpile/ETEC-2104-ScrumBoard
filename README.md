"as a user, I would like to be able to easily login without having to go back to the meme submitter"
Cos-Button in the top right to login if not logged in but a log out button if logged in.
Cos-Login System for users with two text boxes and a Login and a Database to check against
Cos-Username and Password for login so to identify the uploader and allow them to resume meme making
Cos-pictures and captions are saved on site while logging in so you can go back to where you were before logging in. 


I'm confused by mine too and couldn't figure out how to do tests (I know how in theory, i'm struggling with syntax/lists). Another thing is I have the html page ready to receive a username and password input, post, parse and all that fun stuff, but I also have a user class to create a user. I'm just not sure how to combine them and use the input from the page as the parameters for the class object.

I was trying to do mainly backend. I feel like the login/logout buttons will be part of a "main feed" form that will then send the user to the login form (or the logged out main feed).




i know this is all stuff that was done in class but it covers all my contitions of satisfactions except the fromt end button that requires frmt end stuff to be done first
