# ETEC-2104-ScrumBoard
4/13

I attempted to improve on my foundation of the suggestions page in Sprint 1 (including the code that was merged with this after I had turned in Sprint 1). I attempted to utilize building a database to handle stuff like "amount of days logged on" and "storing suggestions." However, I was incredibly confused. I've been very stressed trying to handle multiple assignments at once, and while I started to understand the general idea of how building databases worked, I had trouble figuring out how to get the program to actually work with what I was able to figure out.
