User Story 4: Amber Howell
(This is meant to be a base of sorts considering how many of the user stories listed have to do with profile features.)
"As a user, I would like to have a profile, so I and others can keep track of my various activities throughout the site as well as express myself."

CoS - On account creation, the profile is empty besides the username listed.
I just have the name, layout, and some sort of example bio for testing.

CoS- The empty profile leaves space open for various types of user personalization and activity including, profile picture, bio, and post history.
I'm working with Mark (user status) and CJ (profile picture changing). I have bio semi-implemented currently, and post history has a spot open for it.

CoS- Each user can access their profile through clicking the user icon on the top right of the screen.
Right now it brings you to the empty profile page, but I need a way to associate clicking of the image with the account.

CoS- Each user profile is associated with an account.
CoS- The user must be logged in to affect to their profile.
These two will be further implemented when I get it further along with those who worked more on the account class/logging in.

CoS- Profiles can only be viewed if they are set to public. The only exception being the user can look at their own private profile when logged in.
Currently, only the first part is implemented due to the reasons previously mentioned.
